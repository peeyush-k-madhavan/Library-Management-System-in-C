# Library-Management-System-in-C
C Code for Library Management System

This application based on file handling in C.
I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite,etc. 
Library Management System Project is password-protected, so only authorized person able to login in this application.
Also to increase the redabilty I have broken the application in different function. 
Each function of the project extensively use the file handing function.
